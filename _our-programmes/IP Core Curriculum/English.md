### Curriculum

**The STELLAR Vision**

Children Who Love Reading and Have a Strong Foundation in the English Language

English is taught through stories and texts that appeal to children, with explicit grammar instruction. Students are provided with opportunities to express themselves in an environment where language learning can be enjoyable yet purposeful. Through the reading of engaging stories in class, students get to speak extensively, discussing and sharing their views with the teacher and their peers. The main purpose is to build students’ confidence in speech and writing, and enhance their learning of the language.

### Pedagogy

**Lower Primary STELLAR Strategies**

  

The STELLAR pedagogic model for lower primary is made up of three major teaching strategies:

  

*   Shared Book Approach (SBA)  
    
*   Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA)
*   Learning Centres (LC) \[For P2 and P3\]
*   Differentiated Focus Lessons (DFLs) \[For P1\]
