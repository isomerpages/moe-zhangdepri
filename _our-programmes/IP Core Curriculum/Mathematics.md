<p><strong>Department Focus</strong>
</p>
<p>To nurture enthusiastic pupils who are able to reason logically, communicate
mathematically and solve problems confidently.</p>
<p><strong>Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>The curriculum is based on the MOE Primary Mathematics syllabus which
is guided by the Mathematics framework. The Mathematics framework focuses
on the development of mathematical problem solving ability which involves
the five inter-related components, namely, Concepts, Skills, Processes,
Attitudes and Metacognition.</p>
<p><strong>Pedagogy</strong>
</p>
<p>In Zhangde Primary, we build on pupils’ prior knowledge and skills and
help pupils relate mathematics to everyday life so as to make learning
relevant and meaningful. Pupils are provided with learning experiences
using different strategies including activity-based learning in order to
develop understanding of mathematics concepts and skills. Pupils develop
mastery of skills through practice and application of concepts to consolidate
and extend their learning.</p>
<p><strong>Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>Pupils are provided with a variety of learning experiences that focus
on mathematical skills and concepts to deepen their understanding and develop
mastery. Pupils are encouraged to make sense of the various mathematical
ideas, reason mathematically and apply mathematics to solve a range of
problems including application of mathematics in real-life contexts. To
engage pupils in learning, hands-on activities using resources such as
manipulatives and play-based activities such as games are conducted.</p>
<p><strong>The Concrete-Pictorial Abstract (CPA) Approach</strong>&nbsp;–
Students are engaged in hands-on learning experiences to gain a deeper
understanding of concepts.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Learning Experiences</strong>&nbsp;– Activities such as Math Shopping
Day and Math Trails provide the students with opportunities to apply their
knowledge and skills in real-life situations.</p>

<p><strong>Math Games</strong>&nbsp;- Mathematical concepts are reinforced
through the use of&nbsp;board games and ICT.</p>
