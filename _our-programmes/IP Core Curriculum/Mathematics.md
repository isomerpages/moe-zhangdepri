Mathematics
===========

  

### Department Focus

  

To nurture enthusiastic pupils who are able to reason logically, communicate mathematically and solve problems confidently.

  

### Curriculum

  

The curriculum is based on the MOE Primary Mathematics syllabus which is guided by the Mathematics framework. The Mathematics framework focuses on the development of mathematical problem solving ability which involves the five inter-related components, namely, Concepts, Skills, Processes, Attitudes and Metacognition.

  

### Pedagogy

  

In Zhangde Primary, we build on pupils’ prior knowledge and skills and help pupils relate mathematics to everyday life so as to make learning relevant and meaningful. Pupils are provided with learning experiences using different strategies including activity-based learning in order to develop understanding of mathematics concepts and skills. Pupils develop mastery of skills through practice and application of concepts to consolidate and extend their learning.

  

### Programmes

  

Pupils are provided with a variety of learning experiences that focus on mathematical skills and concepts to deepen their understanding and develop mastery. Pupils are encouraged to make sense of the various mathematical ideas, reason mathematically and apply mathematics to solve a range of problems including application of mathematics in real-life contexts. To engage pupils in learning, hands-on activities using resources such as manipulatives and play-based activities such as games are conducted.

  

·       <b>The Concrete-Pictorial Abstract (CPA) Approach</b> – Students are engaged in hands-on learning experiences to gain a deeper understanding of concepts.
