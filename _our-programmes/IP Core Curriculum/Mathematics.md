<p><strong>Department Focus</strong></p>
<p>To nurture enthusiastic pupils who are able to reason logically, communicate mathematically and solve problems confidently.</p>
<p><strong>Curriculum</strong></p>
<p>The curriculum is based on the MOE Primary Mathematics syllabus which is guided by the Mathematics framework. The Mathematics framework focuses on the development of mathematical problem solving ability which involves the five inter-related components, namely, Concepts, Skills, Processes, Attitudes and Metacognition.</p>
<p><strong>Pedagogy</strong></p>
<p>In Zhangde Primary, we build on pupils&rsquo; prior knowledge and skills and help pupils relate mathematics to everyday life so as to make learning relevant and meaningful. Pupils are provided with learning experiences using different strategies including activity-based learning in order to develop understanding of mathematics concepts and skills. Pupils develop mastery of skills through practice and application of concepts to consolidate and extend their learning.</p>
<p><strong>Programmes</strong></p>
<p>Pupils are provided with a variety of learning experiences that focus on mathematical skills and concepts to deepen their understanding and develop mastery. Pupils are encouraged to make sense of the various mathematical ideas, reason mathematically and apply mathematics to solve a range of problems including application of mathematics in real-life contexts. To engage pupils in learning, hands-on activities using resources such as manipulatives and play-based activities such as games are conducted.</p>
<p><strong>The Concrete-Pictorial Abstract (CPA) Approach</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Students are engaged in hands-on learning experiences to gain a deeper understanding of concepts.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Learning Experiences</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Activities such as Math Shopping Day and Math Trails provide the students with opportunities to apply their knowledge and skills in real-life situations.</p>
<img src="/images/Math2.png">
<p><strong>Math Games</strong>&nbsp;- Mathematical concepts are reinforced through the use of&nbsp;board games and ICT.</p>

<p><strong><u>Enrichment Programmes</u></strong><br>Every year, a group of P5 and P6 students will be selected to take part in the following annual Mathematics competitions.&nbsp;<br /><strong>Raffles Institution Primary Mathematics World Contest (RIPMWC)&nbsp;</strong>organized by Raffles Institution<br /><strong>Singapore Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools&nbsp;</strong>organized by Hwa Chong Institution (High School)</p>
<p><strong><u>River Valley High School Mathematics Challenge (2022)<br /></u></strong>Two of our students, participated in the River Valley High School's Mathematics Challenge this year. Showing great teamwork, versatility, and resilience in solving interesting and challenging real-life Mathematical problems, the pair emerged 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;place among all the participating primary schools. We are incredibly proud of their achievement. Well done!</p>
