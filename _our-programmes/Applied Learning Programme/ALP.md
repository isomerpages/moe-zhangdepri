### <u><b>Developing Zhangde’s GIVER3S Values through Environment Education</b></u>

  

<b>Alignment to School’s Vision, Mission and Values</b>

Zhangde Primary School’s vision of a Learning School With <i>A GIVER3S Heart</i> undergirds the school’s approach towards creating a clean and green school environment where students learn with joy as they engage in authentic learning experiences. Our school endeavours to instil in our students a love and concern for the environment through the inculcation of our GIVER3S values, which is also aligned to the school’s mission of “nurturing thinking individuals and gracious citizens”.

  

The school has developed its own distinctive Environment Education curriculum that provides students with platforms to learn and explore the importance of conserving natural resources. Through these platforms, our school aims to develop future generations of thinking individuals and gracious citizens who are accountable for their own actions, are responsible towards the environment, and innovative in solving problems of a land scarce Singapore. They also share and are passionately involved in the environmental problems of the global community.

  

  

<b>Curriculum</b>

  

Environment Education is infused into the teaching and learning of all subjects to facilitate a more holistic understanding of environment conservation in our students. Our themed gardens also complement Environment Education by providing our students with rich, authentic learning experiences as they engage their heads, hearts and hands in their learning through trails, observation and drawing activities.

1\. Recycling Projects

  

The school has embarked on several recycling projects over the years. These include the recycling of paper, plastic, tetra-paks, ring tabs, electronic equipment, pens and correction tape holders. It is important for our students to do their part for the Environment by not wasting resources and actively re-using items or turning them into new products.

2\. Commemoration of Environment Related Events

  

Students are involved in the Commemoration of Environment Week as well as International Biodiversity Day. During the Environment week, students learn about Energy and water conservation as well as the importance of reusing, reducing and recycling. Assembly programmes and hands-on activities are integrated to enhance their learning.

3\. Learning Journeys & Level-wide camps

  

Learning journeys and camps are organised for all levels to enhance the students’ awareness of the natural and man-made conservation areas and parks found in Singapore. They also learn more about biodiversity and thus better appreciate the importance of conserving them. A highlight for the P3s would be their overnight stay at the Zoo under tents and having the animals around them, it certainly feels like they are on safari!
