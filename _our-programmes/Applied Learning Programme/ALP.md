### <u><b>Developing Zhangde’s GIVER3S Values through Environment Education</b></u>

  

<b>Alignment to School’s Vision, Mission and Values</b>

Zhangde Primary School’s vision of a Learning School With <i>A GIVER3S Heart</i> undergirds the school’s approach towards creating a clean and green school environment where students learn with joy as they engage in authentic learning experiences. Our school endeavours to instil in our students a love and concern for the environment through the inculcation of our GIVER3S values, which is also aligned to the school’s mission of “nurturing thinking individuals and gracious citizens”.

  

The school has developed its own distinctive Environment Education curriculum that provides students with platforms to learn and explore the importance of conserving natural resources. Through these platforms, our school aims to develop future generations of thinking individuals and gracious citizens who are accountable for their own actions, are responsible towards the environment, and innovative in solving problems of a land scarce Singapore. They also share and are passionately involved in the environmental problems of the global community.

  

  

<b>Curriculum</b>

  

Environment Education is infused into the teaching and learning of all subjects to facilitate a more holistic understanding of environment conservation in our students. Our themed gardens also complement Environment Education by providing our students with rich, authentic learning experiences as they engage their heads, hearts and hands in their learning through trails, observation and drawing activities.
