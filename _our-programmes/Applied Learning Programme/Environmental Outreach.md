Environmental Outreach
======================

<b>1\. Cluster Schools</b>

  

In conjunction with International Biodiversity Day (IBD), primary schools from our S4 Cluster are invited to participate in our IBD programme. The students are exposed to the rich diversity of our school gardens and involved in our unique garden trail, ‘Biomon Go’. Students catch BioMons by scanning the AR code using the app in our iPads, view the videos and answer questions on the rich biodiversity in our gardens. In addition, students also started their own gardens by carrying home plants in recycled containers and were shown how we made vermicompost.

<b>2\. Kindergarten Visits</b>

  

Kindergarten students who visit Zhangde are also exposed to our ALP. Led by their buddies, they visit the classes and also learn about plants found in the school garden.
