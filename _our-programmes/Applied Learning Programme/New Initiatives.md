New Initiatives
===============

### <u>Initiatives Introduced in 2019</u>

  

<b>1\. Hydroponics</b>

  

A Hydroponics Programme has been introduced to all P5 classes. Each class has the responsibility to grow and care for vegetable seedlings. At the end of 4 weeks, students are able to harvest their crops. In this programme, students learn that there are different methods of growing plants in an urban environment.

<b>2\. Terrarium-Making</b>

  

The P5 students create their own terrariums at the end of the topic on the Water Cycle as a means to consolidate their learning. This incorporates authentic learning as their terrariums are the micro-environments that show the science concepts of evaporation and condensation as key processes of the water cycle, in a real-life situation. It caters to different learnersâ€™ profiles and the joy of learning in students is obvious as they immerse themselves in the experience.
