### <u>Initiatives Introduced in 2019</u>

  

<b>1\. Hydroponics</b>

  

A Hydroponics Programme has been introduced to all P5 classes. Each class has the responsibility to grow and care for vegetable seedlings. At the end of 4 weeks, students are able to harvest their crops. In this programme, students learn that there are different methods of growing plants in an urban environment.
