<h4><strong>Learning for Life Programme</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Learning for Life Programme – OE @ ZPS</strong>
</p>
<p>Zhangde Primary School’s vision of a Learning School, GIVER3S Heart undergirds
the school’s&nbsp;DARE@ZPS’s&nbsp;approach towards creating a vibrant and
robust learning environment for Outdoor Education, anchored in values.</p>
<p><strong>DARE@ZPS</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>iscovery – Discovering of self and the world around
us;
<br><strong>A</strong>dventure – Acting on adventure and the ‘can-do’ spirit;
<br><strong>R</strong>elationship Building – Reinforcing relationships and
building friendship; and
<br><strong>E</strong>sprit de-Corps – Embracing others, accepting differences
and diversity.</p>
<p>DARE@ZPS aims to immerse our students in an environment of outdoor and
sporting activities to develop socio-emotional competencies and sound values.
Learning for Life Programme on Outdoor Education also acts as a platform
to instil in our students a spirit of adventure through the exploration
of both natural and urbanised environments starting with the local context
and extending it to the rugged outdoor locations. The real-life experiential
learning also helps students develop character, cultivate positive attitudes
and self-expression, build friendships and work as a team towards common
goals as well as embrace others through community engagement.</p>
<p>DARE@ZPS is also aligned to the school’s mission of “Nurturing Thinking
Individuals and Gracious Citizens’ in our students. This is coupled with
the strong focus on the school’s</p>
<p>GIVER<sup>3</sup>S values where our students will embrace giving and contributing
back to the society.</p>
<p><strong>OE@ZPS 3E Tiered Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>The Outdoor Education Framework is executed through a 3E (Experience,
Extend and Embrace) tiered approach both during curriculum or outside curriculum
time</p>
<p><strong>Tier 1 – Experience</strong>
</p>
<p>All students from Primary 1 to 6 are offered a range of learning experiences
that are age-appropriate for their learning. Students are given the opportunity
to develop Outdoor Education skills through PE Outdoor Education curriculum,
Sport Education Programmes and Outdoor Camps. Arising from students’ concrete
experience of doing, they reflect and draw conclusion to apply their learning
to enhance self-management (self-discovery) and build on their social emotional
competencies as well as life skills. Every student is given the same opportunity
to ignite their joy and ‘DARE’ in learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tier 2 – Extend</strong>
</p>
<p>Students with interest and aptitude will be given further opportunities
to hone their Outdoor Education skills through extended skill training
in their various roles. Students from CCAs, Prefects, Physical Education,
National Education and Environment leaders, and Outdoor Education interest
group will engage in outdoor experiences through expeditions and local
or overseas camps</p>
<p><strong>Tier 3 - Embrace</strong>
</p>
<p>With their OE and sports experience, selected students will be given opportunities
to apply their extended skills and become advocates for Outdoor Education
and Environment Education. Students will participate in Outreach through
level Values-In-Action in school and community engagement programmes. Tier
3 is the pinnacle of growth and contribution where students embrace and
give back and contribute to the society.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>OEA Training</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of the OEA’s development, students undergo experiential leadership
training through hands-on lessons and outdoor activities such as trekking
and kayaking. Students learn about various aspects of students, safety
awareness and risk management in an outdoor setting, and about nature conservation
in places such as Labrador park and Pulau Ubin.</p>

<p><strong>OEA Outreach</strong>
</p>
<p>OEAs are involved in various programs so as to learn and share more about
outdoor education with other Zhangderens. For the P1 and P2 students, OEAs
teach and guide them in their LLP day camp where they impart basic life
skills such as knot tying and hygiene. OEAs also partnered NParks to learn
more about nature conservation and environmental awareness on Pulau Ubin.
At the end of the school year, OEAs organized an outreach to share with
their schoolmates what they have learnt in, through and about the outdoors,
inspiring a sense of adventure and curiosity in others!</p>
