Guides for P6 Parents and Students 
===================================

<u><b>S1 Posting Exercise</b></u>


MOE has released the indicative PSLE Score ranges for individual secondary schools. The following are key information from the announcement:

• The indicative PSLE Score ranges for individual secondary schools serve as a good reference point for you and your child/ward as you begin considering secondary school choices.

• Besides the indicative PSLE Score ranges, there are other equally important factors to consider when choosing a secondary school such as schools’ distinctive programmes, schools’ ethos and culture, CCAs as well as home-school distance.

• Your child/ward can also consider the Direct School Admission for secondary schools (DSA-Sec) as an alternative admission pathway.

  

To support you and your child/ward to choose suitable secondary schools under the new PSLE Scoring System, MOE has provided the following resources:

1.    The SchoolFinder website which has information on individual secondary schools and their school programmes, locations etc. The SchoolFinder is an online tool that allows users to search and make a shortlist of schools based on a set of criteria.

2.    The PSLE-Full Subject Based Banding (PSLE-FSBB) Microsite which provides information on commonly asked questions and a Score Calculator to generate possible courses and schools that your child/ward may be eligible for.
