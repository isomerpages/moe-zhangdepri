<p>MOE has released the indicative PSLE Score ranges for individual secondary
schools. The following are key information from the announcement:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The indicative PSLE Score ranges for individual secondary schools serve
as a good reference point for you and your child/ward as you begin considering
secondary school choices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Besides the indicative PSLE Score ranges, there are other equally important
factors to consider when choosing a secondary school such as schools’ distinctive
programmes, schools’ ethos and culture, CCAs as well as home-school distance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your child/ward can also consider the Direct School Admission for secondary
schools (DSA-Sec) as an alternative admission pathway.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To support you and your child/ward to choose suitable secondary schools
under the new PSLE Scoring System, MOE has provided the following resources:</p>

<p>The SchoolFinder website which has information on individual secondary
schools and their school programmes, locations etc. The SchoolFinder is
