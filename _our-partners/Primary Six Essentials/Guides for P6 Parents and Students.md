<p>MOE has released the indicative PSLE Score ranges for individual secondary schools. The following are key information from the announcement:</p>
<ul>
<li>The indicative PSLE Score ranges for individual secondary schools serve as a good reference point for you and your child/ward as you begin considering secondary school choices.</li>
<li>Besides the indicative PSLE Score ranges, there are other equally important factors to consider when choosing a secondary school such as schools’ distinctive programmes, schools’ ethos and culture, CCAs as well as home-school distance.</li>
<li>Your child/ward can also consider the Direct School Admission for secondary schools (DSA-Sec) as an alternative admission pathway.</li>
</ul>
<p>To support you and your child/ward to choose suitable secondary schools under the new PSLE Scoring System, MOE has provided the following resources:</p>
<ol>
<li>The SchoolFinder website which has information on individual secondary schools and their school programmes, locations etc. The SchoolFinder is an online tool that allows users to search and make a shortlist of schools based on a set of criteria.<br><a href="https://go.gov.sg/schoolfinder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://go.gov.sg/schoolfinder</a></li>
