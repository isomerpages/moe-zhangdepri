<p><strong>Application Process<br></strong>Interested parents may wish to
visit MOE’s DSA website (<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/dsa/preferences/submit-preference-form-mainstream-primary-school-child" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.moe.gov.sg/dsa-sec</a>)

<p>DSA-Sec provides a pathway for students to gain admission to secondary
schools based on their interests, aptitude, and potential, beyond their
performance at Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).
<br>
<br>If your child is admitted to a secondary school through DSA-Sec, they
are <strong>not</strong> allowed to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Submit school choices during the Secondary 1 (S1) posting process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer to another school. They <strong>must</strong> commit to their chosen
school for the duration of the programme.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the DSA-Sec is not a pathway that suits every student.
<br>
<br>To determine if DSA-Sec is an appropriate pathway for your child, you
should carefully consider your child's strengths and interests, and the
school's programmes and their ability to develop specific talent.
<br>
<br>Explore the list of schools and programmes for DSA-Sec using SchoolFinder.</p>
