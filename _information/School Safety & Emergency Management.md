<p><strong>Visitors<br></strong>In its efforts to make schools a safe place
for the students to study in, MOE has provided schools with 2 NSRS trained
security guards since May 2005. All visitors are required to report at
the Security Post at the porch for registration. A visitor pass will be
issued to you. After this, please proceed to the General Office to make
arrangements if you want to see your child or meet up with any of our staff.</p>
<p><strong>School Carpark<br></strong>The school carpark is reserved for
the use of the school staff and school buses. Visitors and parents on official
business may park their vehicles at the vacant carpark lots. Parents waiting
to fetch their children home are advised to park their cars at the nearby
HDB carparks. For everyone’s safety, parents are advised to exercise courtesy
and consideration by not holding up traffic especially during peak hours.</p>
<p>On rainy days, school buses will have the priority to park at the porch
area. Drivers are advised to drive into the school only after the buses
have left.</p>
<p>Gates 1 and 2 are for vehicles ONLY. Students and parents walking to school
are advised to enter the school through Gate 3 for safety reasons. Beyond
the stipulated gates opening hours, students and parents are advised to
follow the printed footpath along the bus bay to exit from Gate 2.</p>

<p><strong>Emergency Response<br></strong>An emergency is defined as a sudden
incident involving actual and/or potential loss of lives or damage to property
on a scale in excess of what a school can normally deal with. An emergency
can also include a mishap arousing high public interest and parental concern.</p>
<p>Emergency drills are conducted twice a year in the school to prepare our
students for any such emergency. The fire alarm will be rung continuously
for at least 1 minute, over the PA system. An immediate safety evacuation
to the assembly area is to be carried out by students according to the
following procedure:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Assemble quickly outside the classroom;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listen for instructions over the PA system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Walk briskly to the assembly area by the shortest route immediately;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait for further instructions at the assembly area.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In light of SG Secure, the school will also conduct a lockdown drill and
an evacuation drill to an External Holding Area (EHA). These drills are
part of school efforts to strengthen the emergency preparedness of our
students and staff.</p>
<p><strong>Travel Declaration<br></strong>As part of emergency management
to safeguard your child’s health and that of all children and staff in
the school, students who travel out of Singapore during the holidays and
on long weekends are required to submit their Travel Declarations to the
school. We seek the cooperation of parents/guardians in ensuring this.</p>
<p>You may submit your child’s travel declaration online via the Parents
Gateway(PG) App. Parents who are not on board PG may collect a hardcopy
of the travel declaration form from the general office.</p>
