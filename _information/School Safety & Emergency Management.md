To provide a safe and conducive environment for optimal learning.

  

##### **Safety First in School**

  

*   Always play in open areas allocated for games e.g. the school field, basketball court, parade square and play ground.  
    
*   Play fair and safely.  
    
*   Walk up and down the staircase or along the corridor. Do not run.  
    
*   Queue up to buy food and stationery and for the school bus/van.  
    
*   Wait for the bus to stop before boarding or disembarking.  
    
*   All students must at all times avoid any mischief that is likely to cause any injury to themselves or to others.  
    
*   When you see the lightning risk alert beacon flashing while at play, stop all outdoor activities and move into a sheltered area.

##### **Road Safety**

  

*   Always observe all road safety rules.  
    
*   Always use the zebra crossing, pedestrian crossing and the overhead bridge near the school.  
    
*   Always walk close to the kerb and in a single file if there is no footpath.  
    
*   Always look out for inattentive drivers when crossing the roads even when you have the right of way.  
    
*   Always wait for the bus to come to a complete stop before boarding or alighting.  
    
*   Never dash across the road without looking out for on-coming traffic.  
    
*   Never cross in front of a stationary vehicle or in between two stationary vehicles.  
    
*   Never cross when the ‘red man’ appears or when the ‘green man’ is flashing. Raise your hand when crossing the road.  
    

  

##### **Safety in the Bus**  

  

*   Remain seated at all times.  
    
*   Keep the aisles clear at all times.  
    
*   No playing in the bus.  
    
*   Do not eat, drink or litter in the bus.  
    
*   Do not vandalise the bus.  
    
*   Speak softly so the bus driver will not be distracted.  
    
*   Before alighting the bus, check if you have left anything behind.  
    
*   If there is an emergency, remain calm, listen to the bus driver and follow the instructions carefully.  
    

  

##### **Visitors**

  

In its efforts to make schools a safe place for the students to study in, MOE has provided schools with 2 NSRS trained security guards since May 2005. All visitors are required to report at the Security Post at the porch for registration. A visitor pass will be issued to you. After this, please proceed to the General Office to make arrangements if you want to see your child or meet up with any of our staff.

  

##### **School Carpark**

  

The school carpark is reserved for the use of the school staff and school buses. Visitors and parents on official business may park their vehicles at the vacant carpark lots. Parents waiting to fetch their children home are advised to park their cars at the nearby HDB carparks. For everyone’s safety, parents are advised to exercise courtesy and consideration by not holding up traffic especially during peak hours.

  

On rainy days, school buses will have the priority to park at the porch area. Drivers are advised to drive into the school only after the buses have left.

  

Gates 1 and 2 are for vehicles ONLY. Students and parents walking to school are advised to enter the school through Gate 3 for safety reasons. Beyond the stipulated gates opening hours, students and parents are advised to follow the printed footpath along the bus bay to exit from Gate 2.
