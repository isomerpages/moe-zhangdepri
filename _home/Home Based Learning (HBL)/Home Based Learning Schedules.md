<h2>Home-Based Learning Schedules</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Home-Based Learning (HBL) aims to nurture students to be self-directed
and future-ready learners.</p>
<p>It allows students to take ownership of their learning while building
independence and digital literacy.</p>
<p>For Primary 1 and 2 students, a structured schedule is provided to guide
them through their HBL experience as they are still developing these habits.</p>
<p>For Primary 3 to 6 students, we seek parentsâ€™ support in encouraging your
child to manage their time, complete tasks responsibly, and seek help when
needed.</p>
<p>Together, we can help our students grow into confident and responsible
learners beyond the classroom.</p>
