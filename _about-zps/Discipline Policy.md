</p>
<p><strong>Discipline Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>Discipline is an educative process to guide students to develop self-management,
responsibility, and good character. Disciplinary measures help students
to learn that there are the consequences for their inappropriate behaviours
and actions and take responsibility not to repeat their mistakes. When
violations occur, relevant staff will conduct thorough investigations to
gather all facts and ensure fairness to all parties involved referencing
MOE guidelines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;At our school, we believe that a safe, respectful, and orderly environment
is essential for effective teaching and learning. School rules are put
in place to guide students’ behaviour, develop responsibility, and help
every child grow into a disciplined and respectful individual. The <em>ABC Approach</em> below
is a 3-step method recommended for all students:</p>

<p>Zhangderens are expected to always uphold the school values, both within
and outside the school premises when representing the school.</p>

<p><strong>Offences</strong>
</p>
<p>Offences may include, but are not limited to:</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p><strong>Consequences</strong>
</p>
<p>Consequences are applied fairly and progressively, taking into account
the nature of the offence, the student’s intent, and past behaviour. These
may include:</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>The purpose of consequences is not punishment alone, but to help students
reflect on their actions, understand the impact of their behaviour, and
learn to make better choices.</p>
<p><strong>Partnership with Parents</strong>
</p>
<p>Parents play a key role in reinforcing positive behaviour. The school
works closely with parents to support students who need guidance and to
ensure consistent expectations between home and school.</p>
<p>By working together, we aim to nurture students who are responsible, respectful
and ready to contribute positively to the school.</p>
