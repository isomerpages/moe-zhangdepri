<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

Bahru. He became the Principal of Chiang Teck School in 1927.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr Loo knew the importance of a good education and&nbsp;urged families
to send their children to school. He kept&nbsp;school&nbsp;fees&nbsp;low&nbsp;to
help the poor families&nbsp;in&nbsp;the area and provided school fees subsidies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr and Mrs Loo would often seek old clothes, shoes, books and school bags
from friends to provide for the poor children.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the school could not sustain on donations from the community and well-wishers,
Mr Loo went out to work to provide for the school and family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mdm&nbsp;Chew Cheng Kee who was Mr Loo’s wife and a teacher in the school
then&nbsp;became Principal till World War II which disrupted the school’s

<p>All their seven children were educated in Chiang Teck. Mr Loo carried
out fund-raising after the War to reconstruct the new school building in
1945.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr Loo continued to serve the school as the Director of the School Board
till his death in 1971.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Loo family descendants continue to live out Mr Loo’s legacy and have
been an integral part of the school’s growth till today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr Loo’s son, Mr Loo Sing Chew, joined the school as a teacher in 1950
and took over as Director of Zhangde School Board in 1971.</p>
</li>
<li>

Advisory Committee(SAC) in 1986 and served till 2002.</p>
</li>

till 2010.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Loos donated $50 000 for the construction of the Loo Kian Cheang Library
in 2004.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr Chan Soo Sen, Minister of State for Education, and also the grandson
of Mr Loo, officially opened the Loo Kian Cheang Library on 2 July 2005.</p>

<p>From a humble beginning in rented premises in Kampong Bahru, Chiang Teck
School started its operations in 1923. It served mainly poor Chinese homes
with Mandarin as the medium of instruction. The school was then moved to
Silat Road where a block of four classrooms and a teacher’s hostel were
built. The enrolment soon grew to 300 students. The school had to stop
its operations during World War II and was reconstructed in 1945 to serve
some 500 students.</p>
<p>By 1961, the school had 24 classes with 1,004 students and 27 staff members.
Zhangde (彰德) is the hanyu pinyin name for Chiang Teck. In August 1981,
the School Management Committee decided to close down the school to make
way for other developments in the area. The founders, school management
committee, principals and teachers of Chiang Teck School had made important
contributions towards the promotion of education in Singapore. In recognition
of their efforts, the new school was named Zhangde Primary School.</p>
<p>On 31st August 1984, the school moved to Jalan Bukit Merah and started
functioning on 10th September 1984 with students from Outram Primary School
and Kai Ming Primary School. In the next few years, the school also took
in students from Silat Primary School, Keppel Primary School and Pearl
Park Primary School when these schools closed down.</p>
