===========================

<b>Contributions of Mr Loo Kian Chiang (2nd Principal of the School) and his family</b>

*          Mr Loo knew the importance of a good education and urged families to send their children to school. He kept school fees low to help the poor families in the area and provided school fees subsidies.
*          Mr and Mrs Loo would often seek old clothes, shoes, books and school bags from friends to provide for the poor children. 
*          As the school could not sustain on donations from the community and well-wishers, Mr Loo went out to work to provide for the school and family.
