<h4><strong>Principal's Message</strong></h4>
<p>Dear Parents &amp; Guardians,</p>
<p>On 8th October, I shared with you that I will be retiring at the end of
2025.</p>
<p>I would like to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude for the
tremendous support and encouragement you have given me over the past seven
years. Our school's vision of "A Learning School, Givers Heart" has been
my guiding light as I worked alongside my dedicated staff to build a nurturing
environment where your children could truly thrive. This remarkable journey
would not have been possible without our committed educators, our SAC's
unwavering support, our PSG's positive presence, and the countless ways
you have partnered with us from your homes and offices. Thank you from
the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>I will treasure the wonderful memories created in our classrooms, corridors,
hall, canteen, library, fields, and gardens—spaces where students worked,
played, laughed, and sometimes cried alongside our caring staff. Thank
you for granting me the extraordinary privilege of being part of your children's
educational journey and watching them grow into the remarkable individuals
they are today.</p>
<p>As I leave alongside the Class of 2025 P6 students, we do so with heads
held high and hearts full of excitement for the next chapter of our lives.
To the students who remain, we wish them continued growth and success,
confident that they will flourish under the continued care of Mr Kyaw Saw
Lynn (Principal) and staff of Zhangde Primary School.</p>
<p>With deepest appreciation and warmest wishes for your continued success.</p>
<p>Mrs Rita Dass</p>
<p>Principal (2019-2025)</p>
