<h4><strong>Message from Principal Mr. Kyaw Saw Lynn</strong></h4>
<p>Dear Zhangde Community</p>
<p>It is both an honour and a privilege to serve as the principal of Zhangde
Primary School (ZPS). I am excited to embark on this journey with all of
you, and I look forward to working closely with all students, staff, families,
stakeholders and partners to continue building on the strong foundation
and rich heritage of this vibrant school.</p>
<p><strong>Honouring the Legacy</strong>
</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my predecessor,
Mrs Rita Dass for her strong and strategic leadership, and unwavering commitment
and dedication to the learning and development of students and staff of
ZPS. Under her guidance, ZPS has fostered a safe, inclusive and enabling
environment. I am committed to building on this legacy, deepening our sense
of belonging, and continuing to create a school where every child is valued
for his/her unique ability, interest, passion, and is supported and empowered
to achieve his/her personal excellence. Please refer to “Mrs Rita Dass’
Message” to be inspired by her farewell note to ZPS Family.</p>
<p><strong>What defines the education at Zhangde Primary School?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Zhangde Education provides our students with a variety of learning
opportunities both in school and beyond. At ZPS, we promote the development
and growth in various domains of an all-round education – cognitive, physical,
aesthetic, social, emotional, moral, and leadership – and celebrate the
success of our students’ multiple peaks of personal and collective excellence
in these domains.</p>
<p>At the heart of our holistic education lies our core values, anchored
on the GIVER<sup>3</sup>S Hearts (Graciousness, Integrity, Versatility,
Empathy, Responsibility, Respect, Resilience, Sincerity), fundamental in
shaping the character and the life skills of our students. These values
will guide our students in the way they manage themselves, how they relate
to others, how they make responsible decisions in their lives, and how
they can play a role in fostering a community of graciousness, respect
and empathy.</p>
<p>Guided by the Future of Learning, our holistic education is anchored on
the development of emerging 21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies and value-added
by our two signature school experiences, namely <em>DARE@ZPS</em> (our Learning
for Life Programme on Outdoor Education) and <em>Developing Zhangde GIVER<sup>3</sup>S Values Through Environment Education</em> (our
Applied Learning Programme on Sustainability). Through these learning experiences,
we aim to develop future generations of thinking individuals and gracious
citizens, with strong socio-emotional competencies and sound values, who
are accountable for their own actions, responsible towards the environment,
and innovative and creative in solving real-world issues of land-scarce
Singapore. By tackling real-world tasks that resonate with them and their
communities, students can become agents of change who contribute to the
community and nation.</p>
<p>The key element in the provision of holistic education for our students
is the active involvement and support of all parents and guardians.&nbsp;
We sincerely value the partnership we have with you in supporting your
child’s/ward’s development and growth. Mutual respect and open communication
will form the cornerstone of our partnership and hence our shared success.
Therefore, we would like to request our parents and guardians to reach
out to us with any questions, concerns, or suggestions. Together, we will
do our best in helping our students learn and grow.</p>
<p><strong>The Zhangde’s Promise</strong>
</p>
<p>So, what makes ZPS unique? Zhangde is an inclusive community where we
value diversity. We believe that we are all different, blessed with different
talents, abilities and passions. &nbsp;We learn in different ways and at
different rates. We believe that all our students will do their personal
best and succeed in their own different ways as they learn and grow to
be “thinking individuals and gracious citizens”, guided by the GIVER<sup>3</sup>S
Heart. Therefore, we endeavour to bring the best out of every student based
on their true potential, guided by our Zhangde’s Promise of <strong>“Zhangde for Every Zhangderen!”</strong>
</p>
<p>In 2026, under the theme of “Curious Hearts, Connected Minds — Growing
the Future Together”, we aim to reinforce a culture of inquiry, a sense
of belonging, and our collective purpose for educating the young for the
future. Moving forward, ZPS hopes to grow together as a community of curious
hearts and connected minds — nurturing a culture of joy, inquiry, and shared
growth as we shape the Future of Learning, one learner at a time!</p>
<p>Together as a school community, we aim to <strong>lead well, teach well, learn well and grow well</strong>,
with curious hearts and connected minds!</p>
<p><strong><em>May we be the reason a child loves coming to Zhangde!</em></strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>May our students remember their school experience at Zhangde fondly.</em></strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>Because Zhangde is for Every Zhangderen!</em></strong>
</p>
