Principal's Message
===================

  

At Zhangde Primary School, we value every child as a valuable asset to our family, to the school, to the community, to society and the Nation. We will be committed to our children from the moment they join the Zhangde Family to give them a holistic educational experience to nurture them to be all that they can be. Not only is this the School’s responsibility but it is our children’s right to a balanced, enjoyable and happy education.
