<h4><strong>School Crest &amp; Song</strong></h4>
<p><strong>School Crest</strong></p>
<img src="/images/Schcrest.png">
<p>The motif is based on the letter &lsquo;Z&rsquo; and the overall design is made up of the letter &lsquo;Z&rsquo; and its reflected counterpart.</p>
<p>In the centre is a vertical arrow paving a way for progress towards success and at the horizontal base of the letter &lsquo;Z&rsquo; is an image of an open book that is symbolic of education, while the horizontal lines above represents a balance, symbolising holistic education where there is equal emphasis on both curricular and co-curricular aspects. The mirror image of the letter &lsquo;Z&rsquo; represents a reflective learner who is a role model at all times. The 8 school values form the lines under each letter &lsquo;Z&rsquo; which the school is anchored on and guided by to provide a firm foundation for character building in all our students.</p>
<p>The school crest is based mainly on the letter &lsquo;Z&rsquo; which rests on a background of light blue, signifying a resilient Zhangderen who thrives in the midst of change and challenges.</p>
