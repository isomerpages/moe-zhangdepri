School Crest & Song
===================

##### **School Crest**

![](/images/Schcrest.png)


The motif is based on the letter ‘Z’ and the overall design is made up of the letter ‘Z’ and its reflected counterpart.

  

In the centre is a vertical arrow paving a way for progress towards success and at the horizontal base of the letter ‘Z’ is an image of an open book that is symbolic of education, while the horizontal lines above represents a balance, symbolising holistic education where there is equal emphasis on both curricular and co-curricular aspects. The mirror image of the letter ‘Z’ represents a reflective learner who is a role model at all times. The 8 school values form the lines under each letter ‘Z’ which the school is anchored on and guided by to provide a firm foundation for character building in all our students.

  

The school crest is based mainly on the letter ‘Z’ which rests on a background of light blue, signifying a resilient Zhangderen who thrives in the midst of change and challenges.
