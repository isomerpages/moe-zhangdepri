<h3><strong>Refreshed Guidelines for School-Home Partnership</strong></h3>
<p>Recognising the evolving needs and aspirations of parents and teachers,
MOE and COMmunity and Parents in Support of Schools (COMPASS) have refreshed
the Guidelines for School-Home Partnership to provide clearer guidance
on how they can work together positively and respectfully.</p>
<p>With the goal to raise a happy, confident and kind generation together,
parents and teachers will focus on respectful communication with each other,
being good role models to our children, and supporting them to develop
strong relationships and healthy habits in the digital age. For example,
to enable teachers to focus on their core work in nurturing students, MOE
will work with schools to establish boundaries on communication. Teachers
will respond to work-related messages during work hours, with the exception
of emergencies or exigencies of duty, and use official channels, such as
their official email and office number, when contacting parents.</p>

<h3><strong>Engagement Charter</strong></h3>
<p>To role model the right values and behaviours in our students, MOE will
place greater emphasis on the expected conduct of parents when interacting
with school staff, and the importance of mutual courtesy and respect. MOE
will ensure a safe work environment for staff to thrive in and will take
firm action against individuals who engage in any form of harassment or
abuse towards our staff. These are encapsulated in MOE's Engagement Charter.</p>
