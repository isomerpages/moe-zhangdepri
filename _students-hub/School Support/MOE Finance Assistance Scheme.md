MOE Finance Assistance Scheme
=============================

  

<u><b>OBJECTIVE</b></u>

1.    The objective of the MOE FAS is to help financially needy Singaporean students in Government and Government-aided schools to meet basic schooling expenses.

<u><b>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA</b></u>

2.    Student must be a Singapore citizen enrolled in a Government or Government-aided school and meets either one of the following criteria: 

a.    Gross household income (GHI) as at the time of application does not exceed $2,750 per month; or 

b.    Household per capita income (PCI) as at the time of application does not exceed $690 per month. 

PCI = Monthly GHI / No. of members in the same household

<u><b>HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS</b></u>

3.    Household members include the student, his/her parents, and unmarried siblings of the student, **regardless** of the address. 

4.    Grandparents and other dependants living at the same address may be included on a case-by-case basis. They include: 

a.    Relatives who are **old or sick and are unemployed and dependent** on the family; and 

        b. Child dependant (where the family is the **legal guardian**).

<u><b>GROSS HOUSEHOLD INCOME</b></u>

5.    Gross household income or “GHI” is the total combined income of all family members in the same household, as defined in paragraphs 3 and 4 above. Household income includes any **regular** allowances (e.g. overtime, transport, laundry, and etc) and employee's CPF contribution. Income from other sources (e.g. pension and rental income) must also be included when calculating a family’s GHI.

6.    The following sources of income will not be considered in the computation of GHI: 

a.    National Service allowance earned by National Servicemen; 

b.    Severance compensation and insurance payouts; and 

c.    Alimony payment (including lump sum payment) received for the maintenance of child(ren) and/or ex-spouse_._

7.    If an income earner is on no-pay leave as at the date of application for the MOE FAS, and the total period of his or her no-pay leave is 6 months or less, his or her last drawn income will be included when calculating a family’s GHI.

8.    For students who are staying with one or more legal guardians, the income of the legal guardians and their spouse who are staying in the same household will be taken into account when calculating the GHI for the student’s family.
