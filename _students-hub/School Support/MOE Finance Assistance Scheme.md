MOE Finance Assistance Scheme
=============================

  

<u><b>OBJECTIVE</b></u>

1.    The objective of the MOE FAS is to help financially needy Singaporean students in Government and Government-aided schools to meet basic schooling expenses.

a.    Gross household income (GHI) as at the time of application does not exceed $2,750 per month; or 

b.    Household per capita income (PCI) as at the time of application does not exceed $690 per month. 

PCI = Monthly GHI / No. of members in the same household

<u><b>HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS</b></u>

3.    Household members include the student, his/her parents, and unmarried siblings of the student, <b>regardless</b> of the address.

<u><b>GROSS HOUSEHOLD INCOME</b></u>

5.    Gross household income or “GHI” is the total combined income of all family members in the same household, as defined in paragraphs 3 and 4 above. Household income includes any <b>regular</b> allowances (e.g. overtime, transport, laundry, and etc) and employee's CPF contribution. Income from other sources (e.g. pension and rental income) must also be included when calculating a family’s GHI.

a.    National Service allowance earned by National Servicemen; 

b.    Severance compensation and insurance payouts; and
