SAC Financial Assistance Scheme
===============================

The school also provides financial assistance for pupils who require help but are not eligible for the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme. SAC has set up a fund to help needy Singaporeans. Assistance in the form of waiver of standard miscellaneous fees, free textbooks and free attire may be given subject to clearance by the school.

  

Pupils who have applied to the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme but do not qualify would be considered for the SAC Financial Assistance Scheme.
