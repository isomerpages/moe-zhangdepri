<p><strong>What constitutes &lsquo;homework&rsquo;?<br /></strong></p>
<p>Homework can be given in the form of written work, e-learning work, research, reading assignments, mini projects and preparatory work for a subsequent lesson (e.g. learning multiplication tables and spelling words).</p>
<p><strong>Rationale for assigning homework:</strong></p>
<p>Getting students to do homework serves the following purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enables teachers to evaluate effectiveness of teaching strategies so as to improve instruction;</li>
<li>Reinforces the learning of concepts taught;</li>
<li>Assesses students&rsquo; mastery of the concepts and skills taught, thereby identifying performance gaps and areas where teachers need to focus on for remediation</li>
<li>Gives feedback to students of their own performance and progress in learning and</li>
<li>Triggers students&rsquo; schema and prior knowledge and stimulates interest in a topic or concept to be discussed.</li>
</ol>
