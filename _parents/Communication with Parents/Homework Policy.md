Homework Policy
===============

  

<b>What constitutes ‘homework’?</b>

  

Homework can be given in the form of written work, e-learning work, research, reading assignments, mini projects and preparatory work for a subsequent lesson (e.g. learning multiplication tables and spelling words).

  

<b>Rationale for assigning homework:</b>

  

Getting students to do homework serves the following purposes:

  1.  Enables teachers to evaluate effectiveness of teaching strategies so as to improve instruction;  
    
2.  Reinforces the learning of concepts taught;  
    
3.  Assesses students’ mastery of the concepts and skills taught, thereby identifying performance gaps and areas where teachers need to focus on for remediation  
    
4.  Gives feedback to students of their own performance and progress in learning and  
    
5.  Triggers students’ schema and prior knowledge and stimulates interest in a topic or concept to be discussed.
