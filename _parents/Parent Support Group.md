PSG is also a good platform for parents to connect with one another and to be actively engaged in their child&rsquo;s educational journey.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>The Zhangde PSG has set up a Facebook group,&nbsp;<strong>Zhangde Parents' Exchange</strong>, (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/zhangdeparents">https://www.facebook.com/groups/zhangdeparents</a>), to enable ZPS parents to donate and receive the following new/used items:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>uniforms;</em></li>
<li><em>textbooks; and</em></li>
<li><em>age-appropriate books.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>This platform is created to benefit the ZPS parents' community and promote environmental sustainability, by enabling items (in good condition/new) to be reused and recycled meaningfully.</em></p>
<p><em>All ZPS parents are welcome to join the group. </em></p>
