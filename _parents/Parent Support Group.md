The Zhangde Parent Support Group is made up of like-minded parents who support the school in various ways to enrich the learning experiences of the students and enhance home-school collaboration. PSG is also a good platform for parents to connect with one another and to be actively engaged in their child’s educational journey.

<i>The Zhangde PSG has set up a Facebook group, <b>Zhangde Parents' Exchange</b>, ([https://www.facebook.com/groups/zhangdeparents](https://www.facebook.com/groups/zhangdeparents)), to enable ZPS parents to donate and receive the following new/used items:  
\- uniforms;  
\- textbooks; and  
\- age-appropriate books.  
  
<i>This platform is created to benefit the ZPS parents' community and promote environmental sustainability, by enabling items (in good condition/new) to be reused and recycled meaningfully.</i>

<i>All ZPS parents are welcome to join the group.</i>
