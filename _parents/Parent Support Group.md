====================

### **Overview**

![](/images/PSG1.png)

The Zhangde Parent Support Group is made up of like-minded parents who support the school in various ways to enrich the learning experiences of the students and enhance home-school collaboration. PSG is also a good platform for parents to connect with one another and to be actively engaged in their child’s educational journey. 

  

We would like to invite parents to volunteer (ad-hoc) or be a member of our PSG.
