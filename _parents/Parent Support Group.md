<p>The Zhangde Parent Support Group is made up of like-minded parents who
support the school in various ways to enrich the learning experiences of
the students and enhance home-school collaboration. PSG is also a good
platform for parents to connect with one another and to be actively engaged
in their childâ€™s educational journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would like to invite parents&nbsp;to volunteer (ad-hoc) or be a member

<br><em>The Zhangde PSG has set up a Facebook group,&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Zhangde Parents' Exchange</em></strong><em>, (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/zhangdeparents" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/groups/zhangdeparents</a>), to enable ZPS parents to donate and receive the following new/used items:</em>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><em>uniforms;</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>textbooks; and</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>age-appropriate books.</em>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This platform is created to benefit the ZPS parents' community and promote environmental sustainability, by enabling items (in good condition/new) to be reused and recycled meaningfully.</em>
</p>
<p><em>All ZPS parents are welcome to join the group.</em>
