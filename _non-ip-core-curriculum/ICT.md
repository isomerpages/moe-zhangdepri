<p>The use of ICT in school aims to nurture a community of learners, who
possess the 21st century competencies through effective and responsible
use of technology. Students will first learn how to use technology then
harness it to empower their own learning. This is achieved through the
three programmes spearheaded by the ICT Department.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Literacy Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Digital Literacy Programme aims to develop 21st century competencies in
pupils, through the learning of Basic ICT skills and online collaborative
tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Align to the Digital Literacy Framework (Find, Think, Apply,Create), digital
literacy activities have been infused into the school curriculum, project
work lessons or through enrichment programmes to develop the media literacy
skills of all Zhangderens.</p>
<p><strong>School Coding Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The P1 to P6 coding programme is in line with the school’s Strategic Thrust
1, that is, “nurturing confident and self-directed learners” as well as
the Applied Learning Programme, which focuses on ‘Developing Zhangde GIVER3S
Values through Environment Education’.</p>
<p>Coding will enable students to develop 21st&nbsp;Century Competencies
and skills, putting&nbsp;children in control of the computer and building
mastery in sequencing skills, counting, problem solving, logical thinking,
creative and critical thinking. Having these skills would help the children
in all subjects and build a strong foundation for their future work-life.</p>

<p>Lesson structure: 4 sessions X 2 hours for P3 to P5, 10 lessons X 1 hour
for P1 and P2 (IPW lessons)</p>
<p>Through the learning experiences from this programme, we hope that the
students will develop a basic understanding of coding, acquire basic engineering
and design skills and be exposed to science, technology and engineering
practices.</p>
<p><strong>Curriculum Integration<br></strong>ICT is integrated into subjects
to empower pupils’ learning. It also aims to encourage pupils to be Self-Directed
Learners and ignite their passion for life-long learning.</p>
<p><strong>Cyber Wellness Programme<br></strong>Cyber Wellness Programme
follows the MOE Cyber Wellness Framework and adhered to the guiding Two
Principles: ‘Respect for Self and Others’ and ‘Safe and Responsible Use’.</p>
<p>There are three key programmes under Cyber Wellness.</p>
