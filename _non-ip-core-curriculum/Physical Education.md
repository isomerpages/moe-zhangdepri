Physical Education
==================

  

### Department Focus

  

The purpose of physical education is to enable students to demonstrate individually and with others the physical skills, practices, and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living.

  

<b>Goal 1:</b> Acquire a range of movement skills to participate in a variety of physical activities.

  

<b>Goal 2:</b> Understand and apply movement concepts, principles and strategies in a range of physical activities.

  

<b>Goal 3:</b> Demonstrate safe practices during physical and daily activities with respect to themselves, others and the environment.

  

<b>Goal 4:</b> Display positive personal and social behaviour across different experiences.

  

<b>Goal 5:</b> Acquire and maintain health-enhancing fitness through regular participation in physical activities.

  

<b>Goal 6:</b> Enjoy and value the benefits of living a physically active and healthy life.


  

Physical education teachers consciously make use of movement as the primary medium to reach and teach the whole child through the following three modes:

  

*   education in movement;  
    
*   education through movement; and  
    
*   education about movement

![](/images/PE.png)

The lower primary level focuses on mastery of fundamental motor skills such as locomotor, non-locomotor and manipulative skills with application of movement concepts to develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in students’ performance. Once the foundation is laid, the upper primary level extends on the mastery of discrete skills to focus on more complex combinations and sequences of movements, and skills application in more recognisable forms of activity and games.
