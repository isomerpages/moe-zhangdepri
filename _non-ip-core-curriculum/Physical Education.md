<h4><strong>Department Focus</strong></h4>
<p>The purpose of physical education is to enable students to demonstrate
individually and with others the physical skills, practices, and values
to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1:</strong>&nbsp;Acquire a range of movement skills to participate
in a variety of physical activities.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2:</strong>&nbsp;Understand and apply movement concepts,
principles and strategies in a range of physical activities.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3:</strong>&nbsp;Demonstrate safe practices during physical
and daily activities with respect to themselves, others and the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4:</strong>&nbsp;Display positive personal and social behaviour
across different experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5:</strong>&nbsp;Acquire and maintain health-enhancing fitness
through regular participation in physical activities.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 6:</strong>&nbsp;Enjoy and value the benefits of living a
physically active and healthy life.</p>
<p>Physical education teachers consciously make use of movement as the primary
medium to reach and teach the whole child through the following three modes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>education in movement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>education through movement; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>education about movement</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/PE.png">
</div>
<p>The lower primary level focuses on mastery of fundamental motor skills
such as locomotor, non-locomotor and manipulative skills with application
of movement concepts to develop efficiency, effectiveness and versatility
in students’ performance. Once the foundation is laid, the upper primary
level extends on the mastery of discrete skills to focus on more complex
combinations and sequences of movements, and skills application in more
recognisable forms of activity and games.</p>
