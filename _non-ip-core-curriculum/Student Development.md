Student Development
===================

### **Department Focus**

·        Build a culture of care in which students enjoy coming to school, are engaged in learning, motivated to give their best, and feel an attachment to the school because they feel safe and cared for in school, enhancing TSR and SSR.

·     Promote a whole-school approach through involving all teaching staff, who are form and subject teachers, in providing for student development and well-being.

·     Provide support and intervention for specific groups of students who require additional help.
