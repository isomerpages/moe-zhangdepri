Boys' Brigade
=============

The Boys’ Brigade (BB) is the world’s first uniformed organisation for youth. The BB method in the development of youth has proven to be successful in moulding Boys to be responsible Men in the Family, the Community, the Nation and the World.  

  

We aim to engage the boys from P2 to P6, in fun, meaningful and challenging activities such as drills, games, achievement award lessons, occasional hikes, camps and outings to develop them physically, mentally, socially and spiritually.

  

35J is the Junior Section Company operating in Zhangde Primary School. Since 1995, we are one of the few Junior Section Companies to receive a Gold JM Fraser Award regularly.
