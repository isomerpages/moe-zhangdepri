<h4><strong>Wushu Club</strong></h4>
<p>The ZPS Wushu Club was formed in 2008. Currently, we have members ranging
from P3 to P6. The club participates in the National School Games yearly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Members are reminded to always display good sportsmanship in competitions
and games. Values such as versatility and resilience are also emphasised
during CCA trainings so that members persevere and endeavour to achieve
their personal best.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Apart from competing in Wushu competitions, our members also perform at
various school and public events. The performances include solo and group
routines. Some performances include our yearly Chinese New Year concerts
as well as our schoolâ€™s Open House.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Newcomers will be introduced to the basic stances and techniques of Wushu.
Our Wushu coaches identify members who show potential and positive learning
dispositions to be enrolled into the school team. School team members will
attend extra training sessions and prepare for competitions. Through this
differentiated approach to training, our Wushu members seek to continually
improve oneself and achieve greater heights.</p>
