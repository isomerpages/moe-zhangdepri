Badminton
=========

The roots of Badminton can be traced back to ancient Greece, India and China. Badminton first appeared in the Olympic Games in 1972 as a demonstration sport. Today, it is one of the top 5 racket sports in the world. Badminton is also one of the sports CCA in our school. Members undergo training sessions by the teachers-in-charge to develop their skills progressively. During each training session, the members learn the skills and strategies required to play the sport. In addition, training sessions aim to increase physical coordination and concentration of the mind. This helps to stimulate the body, as well as the mind, increasing mental stamina and adeptness. We seek to build character, develop teamwork, promote responsibility and foster a sense of camaraderie among our members. It is important for our members to understand and practice the value of sportsmanship during the training sessions. Through friendly games and intra-level competitions held in school, our Badminton CCA enables members to forge friendships and further develop the school’s GIVER³S values such as versatility, resilience, respect and responsibility.
