Floorball
=========

  

Floorball is a relatively new sport that has been making waves in the local sports scene. It is a fast-paced, exciting, safe and low-cost sport played indoors with plastic sticks and a ‘light weight plastic ball. At first glance, it resembles floor hockey but it is played with rules that make the game play faster yet safer. In addition, each team has four field players and a goalie without a stick.

In Zhangde Primary School, our pupils are taught the fundamentals such as passing, dribbling, shooting and ball control in the presence of a qualified floorball coach. Pupils who show great potential in the sport will be selected to represent the school in national competitions organised twice annually (senior and junior games).

Floorball is incorporated into the PE syllabus and hence all Zhangderens will get to learn to play the sport during their PE lessons. On top of that, they also get to play the sport with their peers during the ‘Active Recess’.

Great emphasis is placed on basic skills, teamwork and communication during play. Pupils will also learn the importance of teamwork and most importantly, be able to keep fit and in shape in a fun way!
