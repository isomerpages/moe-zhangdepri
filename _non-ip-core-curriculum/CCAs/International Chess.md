<h4><strong>International Chess</strong></h4>
<p>Your body needs exercise, and so does your brain!</p>
<p>At Zhangde International Chess Club, members exercise their brain through learning and practising International Chess tactics. Members also put their skills to test in real game play sessions during CCA. The Zhangde International Chess Club also incorporates the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) during training where members go online to practise their game tactics and play with International Chess enthusiasts from around the world. Through participating in practices and competitions, members are able to develop patience, critical thinking skills and build their self-esteem.</p>
