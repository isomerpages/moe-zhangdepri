Malay Dance
===========

Zhangde Primary School Malay Dance group has been around for more than 10 years. Our Malay dance members comprises of male and female students from primary 3 to 6 levels. Our weekly CCA practice is scheduled on every Friday morning from 7.30am to 9.30am.Â 

The Malay dance weekly practice sessions expose students to a repertoire of traditional Malay dance forms such as Zapin, Joget, Masri, Asli dan Inang. Besides acquiring the knowledge of Malay dance techniques, students also learn the values of responsibility, versatility and resilience that is in line with our school values.

The Malay dance CCA also aims to instil confidence in our students while performing and at the same time showcasing their talent through the various performances in school and outside school. This year, we will be participating in the Singapore Youth Festival 2020. For the first time, we will be performing a contemporary dance for the competition. The students have been putting in a lot of effort to put up a wonderful performance for SYF 2020.
