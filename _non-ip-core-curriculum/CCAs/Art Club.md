<h4><strong>Art Club</strong></h4>

<p>Art is all around us. Children love doing a variety of artworks as an outlet to be creative and have fun. They get to develop their observation and psychomotor skills as they create their artworks. While working on their artworks, they get to develop self regulation, self-esteem and interact with peers to have fun.</p>
<p>The Art Club is established to cater to&nbsp;the needs and interest of students to learn and appreciate art. Besides creating 2-dimensional art pieces in the form of drawing (pencil sketching, cartoon drawing, poster design, paper-cutting and etc), students also get to create 3-dimensional art pieces (paper puppets, paper clay modeling, origami and etc). As the students have a high level of interest in Art, we look forward to supporting them in their development in areas of Aesthetics</p>
