<h4><strong>Environmental Science Club</strong></h4>
<p>The Environmental Science Club aims to inspire and empower students to
become environmentally conscious citizens and active stewards of earthâ€™s
resources. Through research and hands-on activities, we foster information-gathering
and problem-solving skills that promote sustainable living practices. We
provide opportunities for club members to creatively address environmental
challenges and engage with the community through collaborative projects.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our club activities include workshops, talks, and collaborative sustainable
gardening with the elderly from Kim Tian West RC. Members learn about composting,
organic farming, sustainable gardening practices and scent-bag making.
Additionally, club members conduct research on plants and their uses as
well as develop innovative solutions, focusing on building structures that
promote sustainable design principles.</p>
