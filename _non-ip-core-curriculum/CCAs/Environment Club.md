Environment Club
================

Environment Club aims to promote greater awareness and appreciation towards the natural environment in our school, community and Singapore. In doing so, it encourages our members to be more environmentally conscious and most importantly have a greater sense of environmental responsibility.

Members learn about vermi-composting and take on initiatives such as using the vermi-tea (_also known as ‘worm tea’_) to fertilise the vegetables and other plants and trees in the school gardens. They also tend to our school gardens and conduct weekly maintenance of it with the help of parent volunteers.

Concurrently, teachers also conduct hands-on activities which bring greater awareness of our environment. For example, topics covered include: Recycling of food waste, Global warming, Identification of flora & fauna, Habitats and even Introduction of ferns. External vendors are also brought in during CCA sessions to engage students with more hands-on activities that are closely-related to the Primary Science syllabus. Members had a chance to inspect specimens of insects. They even headed out to learn about forces via the launching of their water rockets created using recycled materials.

Every year, there will be a member selection for students to be Garden Rangers. They are trained by our teachers-in-charge and Science teachers on the different types of plants found in our school’s gardens. These students get a chance to showcase their expertise to visitors during school events as well as school visits when they lead visitors on garden trails and introduce the various species of plants to our guests. 

ZPS Environment Club has also been an active participant in NParks’ ‘Greening Schools for Biodiversity’, ‘Science Communication for CIN (Community in Nature) Ambassadors’ as well as ‘BioBlitz for Schools’ programmes. These programs expose our members to a wide range of experiences, knowledge and activities that help them establish linkages between the content learned in schools as well as the real-world context.
