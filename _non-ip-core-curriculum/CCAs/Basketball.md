<h4><strong>Basketball</strong></h4>
<p><strong>BASKETBALL (BOYS)</strong></p>
<p>The scintillating sport of basketball not only enhances one&rsquo;s overall fitness but it also helps to strengthen discipline, camaraderie and teamwork amongst the student athletes. At our friendly but focused playing environment, they are given opportunities to excel in the various essential aspects of the sport, such as rebounding or lay-ups, under the technical guidance of a dedicated coach. A team of passionate teachers would also provide more insights into the other aspects of the game. </p>
<p>Student athletes will also be able to forge strong friendships amongst peers and develop resilience as they pursue sporting excellence through the annual South Zone Primary Schools Basketball Championships.&nbsp;They would also be able to further enhance their psycho-motor skills, stamina, sportsmanship and confidence. There would be many opportunities for each player to gradually realise his true potential and develop resilience.</p>
