<h4><strong>Indian Dance</strong></h4>
<p>The Indian Dance CCA was established to provide an opportunity to appreciate the fine aesthetics of Indian Dance. The main objectives of the CCA are to promote passion and provide students with opportunities to develop their talent in Indian Dance. It is a platform for pupils to showcase their capabilities and strengths in the performing arts. With guidance from the dance instructor and teachers, pupils master the basic movements of the art form; &lsquo;Bharatanatiyam&rsquo;. Throughout this learning journey, our dancers have gained resilience and determination through adopting a growth mindset where challenges are viewed as opportunities to grow. These experiences have played a significant role in instilling the school&rsquo;s core values in the students, as well as equipped them with 21st century skills. Pupils gain exposure as they get to partake in national competitions such as the bi-annual Singapore Youth Festival (SYF). On top of that, they also get to display their efforts during select school events and programmes organized by external organisations.&nbsp;</p>
