<h4><strong>Robotics Club</strong></h4>
<p>At Zhangde Robotics club, our training programme focuses on developing
membersâ€™ competencies in building and operating robots as a team under
the guidance of a professional trainer. Basic robotics and simple programming
skills are taught to create movements in the robots in order to complete
task assigned.</p>
<p>Through team work, pupils learn how to communicate and cooperate well
with one another. They also learn to be responsible individuals as they
contribute ideas and findings in order to fix and operate their robots.</p>
<p>Students will be given ample opportunities to compete in various robotics
competitions where they could pitch their skills against others to create
robots that are innovative.</p>
