Robotics Club
=============

  

At Zhangde Robotics club, our training programme focuses on developing members’ competencies in building and operating robots as a team under the guidance of a professional trainer. Basic robotics and simple programming skills are taught to create movements in the robots in order to complete task assigned . 

Through team work, pupils learn how to communicate and cooperate well with one another. They also learn to be responsible individuals as they contribute ideas and findings in order to fix and operate their robots.   

Students will be given ample opportunities to compete in various robotics competitions where they could pitch their skills against others to create robots that are innovative.
