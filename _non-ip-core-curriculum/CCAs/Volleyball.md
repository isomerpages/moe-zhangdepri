Volleyball
==========

Volleyball is a net barrier team-sport game. Students practice the game through drills that involves serving, setting, throwing, passing, digging and spiking. Techniques and strategies of attacking and defending are also taught through activities and practices. This helps to hone students’ fundamental skills, while at the same time, develops students’ fitness conditioning. 

Being a team-sport, volleyball gives students the opportunity to demonstrate sportsmanship during training and competitions. Volleyball also opens up platforms for students to demonstrate their leadership capabilities to lead and influence members with positive attitudes and qualities.
