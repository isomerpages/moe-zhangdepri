<h4><strong>Table Tennis</strong></h4>
<p>The Table Tennis CCA comprises of a boys and girls school team and the recreational team.</p>
<p>During our CCA sessions, pupils will learn the basic skills of table tennis such as how to serve the ball, backhand and forehand. They will also train to become even more proficient in the sport with the guidance of the coach and teachers in charge</p>
<p>We strive to create an encouraging environment that is conducive to the pupilsâ€™ development which stresses on teamwork, responsibility for the equipment, their own behaviour and respect for fellow teammates, teachers and coaches.</p>
