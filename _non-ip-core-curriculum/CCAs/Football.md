Football
========

The Football CCA in Zhangde Primary School prides itself to be one of the most popular choices of CCA among the students. During the Football CCA programme, the students are taught basic football techniques, such as passing, dribbling and shooting. As the students progress in their skills, they get to practise what they have learnt through competitive games and learn how to work effectively as a team. While developing the right techniques in football is important, our Football CCA programme ensures that character building and values inculcation are infused into our training. The students are taught the values of resilience, teamwork and graciousness through meaningful training activities and the importance of fair play. Â Through our football programme, we hope to develop young football players who lead by example both on and off the field.
