<h4><strong>International Dance</strong></h4>
<p>The International Dance CCA is a new CCA which is started this year in
Zhangde Primary School. It is a merger of the previous Chinese, Indian
and Malay dance CCAs so as to promote cross cultural &nbsp;learning. Its
aim is to provide a platform for students to pursue their passion in dance
while developing perseverance, team-work and inculcating respect for the
performing arts. Dancers are constantly reminded about the importance of
working together and being resilient while practicing their dance moves.
Gradually, they have grown to become responsible individuals who take pride
in their CCA.</p>
<p>The International Dance CCA also aims to instill self-confidence in our
students while performing and at the same time showcasing their talent
through the various performances in school and outside school. This year,
our dancers participated in the International Friendship Day celebration.
They also participated in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation
2024 and had clinched the Certificate of Accomplishment for the International
Dance Category! Great job, dancers!</p>
