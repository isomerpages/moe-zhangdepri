### Department Focus

  

To nurture gracious citizens, the school emphasises character development, national education and stays close to community needs, collaborating and partnering with the community in programmes which develop civic mindedness and environmental ownership. This is encapsulated in our school vision “A Learning School with a **GIVER3S** Heart”. The school also continues to pay attention to the acquisition of 21st Century Competencies by our pupils through a compendium of learning activities within and outside of classroom.
