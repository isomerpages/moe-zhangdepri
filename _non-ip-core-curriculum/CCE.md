### Department Focus

  

To nurture gracious citizens, the school emphasises character development, national education and stays close to community needs, collaborating and partnering with the community in programmes which develop civic mindedness and environmental ownership. This is encapsulated in our school vision “A Learning School with a **GIVER3S** Heart”. The school also continues to pay attention to the acquisition of 21st Century Competencies by our pupils through a compendium of learning activities within and outside of classroom.

##### **Explicit Teaching**  

  

Both Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) and Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons focus on the teaching of Values, Knowledge, skills and competencies which are important for character and citizenship development. CCE lessons are mainly\* conducted in the Mother Tongue languages (MTL). \*For those pupils who exempted from taking MTL, CCE will be taught in English.

  

During Social Studies lessons, students discuss the implications on current issues and topics faced by the community, nation and world. They also learnt to look from different perspectives and understand the impact on individual and community. This helps to promote development to critical thinking skills, reflective skills and create understanding of what is meant to be a good citizen.


##### **CCE School-based learning experiences**

  

<i><b>Values Of The Term (VOTT)</b></i>

  

Each term, two school values are selected to set the focus for the classroom, co-curricular and various activities thereby allowing purposeful participation on an extensive and expansive level. Assembly Programs are also used as a teaching platform for school values.
